# Coin Flip Simulator
#### It's like flipping burgers, but cooler!

This program simulates a coin flip a certain number of times and then displays the results. It also does some very basic analysis on the flips.

Command line arguments are included to bypass the simple CLI:

```
-n: Number of times to run the simulation. Example usage: -n 1000
-l: Name of logfile. Example usage: -l log NOTE: If you don't want a logfile created, use -l n or -l no
-o: To show or not to show visual output. Example usage: -o y OR -o n
```

## TODO

* Estimated completion time based on 10000 (TBD) simulated flips.
* Improve command line arguments to be less stupid. Specifically....
* Add a logfile switch.
* Change output to be a true switch.
